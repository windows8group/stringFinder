The time has come to an end
Yeah - this is what nature planned

Being tracked by the entire world
Just for some never-released trans(lations)
Looking for a way to trans(late)
A coder hunts for strings
Close to his last breath
Getting close to his last breathhhhh

RULES OF TRANSLATION

And it runs when the work is done (nice)
With his rules of translation
(NO BUG)
For a while
(HAS BUGS)
Gotta find the way to fixxxxxx
(MUST FIX)
Everyone counts on me
(NO CHOICE)
Out here only the strong survive...

What's done is done
Survived to see another day
The dance of text
The need for a proper trans(lation)
No guarantee
How it will succeed
Good or not
